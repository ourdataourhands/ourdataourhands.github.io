    <h2>Rise up!</h2>
    <p>Governments all over the world generate and store petabytes of data &ndash; for citizen access. Inspired by <a href="http://www.climatemirror.org/">ClimateMirror.org</a>, <a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge">DataRefuge</a> and <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/">many</a> <a href="http://archiveteam.org/">others</a>, we want to change that.</p>

                <p class="value-description">Governments change. Priorities change. Sadly, science and data does not always occupy high regard. Public data in public hands can be shielded from politics and alternative facts.</p>

                <p class="value-description">The only way to compete with the <strong>vast</strong> amount of data storage that government has, is for millions of people to band together what we already have.</p>

    <h2>What can I do to help?</h2>
    <h3>Buy a storage pod</h3>
    <p>We're not ready to sell these pods just yet, but here's the idea:
    <ol>
        <li>Buy a storage pod from us &ndash; small computer & HDD, ~$150 &ndash; tax deductible</li>
        <li>Receive it in the mail, plug it in &ndash; no setup</li>
        <li>Sit back and contribute to the grid &ndash; feel great!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please join our email list and we'll let you know when they are ready!</p>
    <h3>Contribute space from your own computer</h3>
    <p>The operating system that will run on the storage pod will be <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs">Tahoe-LAFS</a> based. As a result, our hope is that you will be able to run it in a container on your own computer.</p>
    <h3>Contribute ideas and code</h3>
    <p>We'd love to hear your thoughts, we'd love to have you contribute your skills. We're doing all of this in the open on <a href="http://github.com/ourdataourhands">Github</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/ourdataourhands/non-profit">running the non-profit</a> itself.</p>
